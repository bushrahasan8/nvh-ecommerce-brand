<a id="goal"></a>

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

I built NVHÂ® (Nzar Velvet Hour) to create a beautiful and luxury online store for skincare products. The goal was to make shopping easy, smooth, and elegant, just like the brand itself.

This project is not just a store, it also has a powerful Admin Dashboard, where store owners can see sales, manage orders, and update products with ease.

I wanted to build something clean, modern, and fast, using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React, and ShadCN UI. This project is not only a great online shop but also a big step in my journey as a Frontend Engineer.

## NVHÂ® is more than just a website, itâ€™s a luxury shopping experience, built with care and love.
